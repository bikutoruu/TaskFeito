TaskFeito is a simple and intuitive task management application designed to help you keep track of your daily to-do's. This project serves as a **beta version** primarily for study and development purposes, but it's fully functional in what it promises!

## Features

With TaskFeito, you can easily:

* **Add New Tasks:** Quickly jot down new tasks to remember.

* **Remove Individual Tasks:** Mark tasks as done or delete them when they are no longer needed. (This feature implies that the user will be able to interact with individual tasks in the list, even if not explicitly shown in the current UI screenshot).

## Upcoming Enhancements

This current version of TaskFeito stores data temporarily (in-memory). We are actively working on a more robust and complex version that will include:

* **Database Integration:** For persistent storage of your tasks, ensuring your to-do's are saved even after closing the app.
* **Enhanced Task Management:** Features like task editing, due dates, priority settings, and more!

Stay tuned for future updates!
